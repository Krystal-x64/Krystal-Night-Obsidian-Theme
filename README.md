# Krystal Night (Obsidian Theme)

## Abstract

An obsidian theme focused on pentesting and documentation PDF reports.
Based on Obsidianite theme by Benny Guo https://github.com/bennyxguo/Obsidian-Obsidianite/
This theme is a modification of Obsidianite made by Krystal,
focused on the use of PDF documentation export,
fixing various visual bugs and improving the design focused for my personal use.

## Story

This "theme" arose based on the disagreement I had that the obsidian themes are not aesthetically and functionally optimized to export PDF files aimed at documentation and reports on penetration tests.
So I chose an already created theme, and wrote and modified CSS code on it, and this is the result.

## Differences from the original

1 - Headers centered and without that annoying black line that underlines them from h2 to h6.

2 - Different font colors, optimized for white background in pdf

3 - Smarter tables, their size can be modified and they have a different design

4 - Long one-line codes were "lost" or cropped when exported in PDF, this was corrected so that the code is seen in its entirety, since it is very important in documentation that no crucial information is lost.

## Soon...

In some future I will put visual examples of before and after, and examples of reports and writeups together in their .md
